This repository contains datasets of mutualistic networks of plants and pollinators that were used to support our work entitled "Interspecific competition drives the structural stability of mutualistic networks".

The files "MPL001.csv "-"MPL050.csv " are the datasets we used in this study. In each .csv file, the first row and the first column are the name of pollinators and plants, respectively. The elements of 1 represent mutualistic interactions between the corresponding plant and pollinator species. For interactions with positive weights, we make the weights to uniform weights of 1 to represent who interact with who.

Please refer to https://www.web-of-life.es/ for more details of the data.
